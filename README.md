# EV Charging Geospatial Mapping

This project uses Python, GeoPandas, and Folium to map and analyze electric vehicle charging stations. It demonstrates practical spatial analysis techniques including proximity visualization, clustering, and dynamic mapping.

## Features
- Load and plot EV station data using GeoPandas
- Generate interactive maps with Folium
- Apply spatial clustering to group charging stations
